Arbitrage is defined as the simultaneous purchase and sale of an asset in order to profit from a difference in the price. Although this is a traditional marketing concept, this project explores the potential for arbitrage opportunities via bitcoin exchange. 

The python program included in this repository, entitled Arbitrage.py, searches through Bitcoin exchange websites for arbitrage opportunities with the highest potential profit margins, and outputs these opportunities to console.
